# Illumina RNA-Seq fastq files produced by Choi et al. (2017) were aligned to the 
# reference genome using the online Galaxy web interface, maintained by the 
# University of Glasgow. 
# These were obtained from ftp://ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk : 

SRR3136984_1.fastq
SRR3136984_2.fastq
SRR3136980_1.fastq
SRR3136980_2.fastq
SRR3140154_1.fastq
SRR3140154_2.fastq

# Files were made ready for alignment using FASTQ Groomer v1.1.1. Default 
# (basic) options were used (Blankenberg et al., 2010).
# Next, RNA-Seq was aligned using HISAT2 v2.1.0 (Kim et al., 2015). Default 
# options were used, and data was run ‘unstranded’. Note that HISAT2 also 
# required samtools v1.4 as a dependency.
