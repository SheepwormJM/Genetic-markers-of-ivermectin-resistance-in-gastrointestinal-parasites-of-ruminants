# Genetic-markers-of-ivermectin-resistance-in-gastrointestinal-parasites-of-ruminants

Hi there!
This is a repository of scripts used during my PhD looking for genetic markers of ivermectin resistance in the sheep parasitic nematode, Teladorsagia circumcincta.
I had a lot of advice from Dr Stephen Doyle, and some scripts have been given by him.
Any mistakes are my own! 
If they are useful to you then please adjust them as needed. Any questions then email me and I will try to answer you as best I can.
