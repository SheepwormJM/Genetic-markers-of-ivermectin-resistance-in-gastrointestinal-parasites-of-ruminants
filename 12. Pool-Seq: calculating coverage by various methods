# Various different methods were used to assess genome wide coverage

# 1. The genome-wide-coverage was calculated by:
# (n reads * length of read)/length of genome

# 2. To calculate the mean depth for each genomic site:
samtools-1.3 depth -q 20 \
<file_name>.merged.sorted.marked.bam \
> \
<file_name>.depth

# 2. To calculate the number of sites with a given mean depth by bins of ten, #from a depth of 1 to a depth of 1000.

samtools-1.3 stats -c 1,1000,10 \
-d <file_name>.merged.sorted.marked.bam \
> \
<file_name>.coverage

# 3. To calculate the coverage by read count within given window sizes
# using bedtools suite (Quinlan, 2014; Quinlan and Hall, 2010)

# Firstly, need to make windows using the genome. 
# For this example, the window size is related to the mean gene length.

# To use as input the indexed fasta file, which has the chr/end basepair.
# Need to first make this into a bed file 

awk '{print $1 "\t" 1 "\t" $2}' <file_name>.fa.fai \
> \
<file_name>.bed

# Make the windows:
bedtools makewindows -b <file_name>.bed \
-w 6415 > \
<file_name>.gene_windows.bed

# Next calculate the number of reads per window for each sample:
# Supply all .bam files required
# -f indicates the minimum read overlap with a window required
# This example also filters the reads by MAPQ>=20

bedtools multicov -f 37E-9 -q 20 -bams \
<name_of_file>.merged.sorted.marked.bam \
<name_of_file>.merged.sorted.marked.bam \
-bed <genome_name>.gene_windows.bed \
> \
<name_of_file>.bed
